peaberry
========
The peaberry project is an extension library for Google-Guice that supports dependency injection of dynamic services. It provides OSGi integration out of the box, and has plug-in support for other registry-based service frameworks. It ships as an OSGi bundle that can be dropped into any R4 framework, such as Apache Felix or Eclipse/Equinox. You can also use peaberry outside of OSGi.
